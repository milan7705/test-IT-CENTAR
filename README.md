Due to time constraint I did not get a chance to finish the filtering feature. The way I would do this by checking the status property of the invoice and showing/hiding based on selected filter.
Another thing I didn't get a chance was to dynamically save data into local storage. I would do this by writing a method that would parse that data into a JSON file.
